      <h4>Our Approach</h4>
      <p>
        We characterize our trading activity as following three general
        approaches —
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Liquidity providing: making markets, buying and selling products to
            provide liquidity for market participants, with execution on a
            trading floor, over the phone and electronically.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Risk taking:&nbsp;doing our homework, formulating a view and putting
            on a position.&nbsp;Some positions are held for a few days, some for
            a few months or even years.&nbsp;
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Latency sensitive trading: combining research and risk management
            with superior technology and execution on our own extensive global
            radio frequency (RF) network
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Trading in any asset class might include just one of these or may bring
        together all three; it all depends on what we see as the right strategy.
        Our knowledge of the markets, pricing and modeling skills, robust risk
        management, and application of technology work together to create
        liquidity, improve market efficiency and capture opportunities.

        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
        1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
        make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but
        also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
        unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
        sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
        publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
        Ipsum.
